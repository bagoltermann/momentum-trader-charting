# Session Notes - 2026-01-15

## Status
✅ **Complete** - Backend running, project infrastructure set up

## Session Overview
1. Diagnosed startup error (FileNotFoundError for data directory)
2. Created auto-detection startup scripts for Windows and Linux/Mac
3. Created `.clinerules` file for project guidelines
4. Set up session notes structure
5. Created FEATURE_SUGGESTIONS.md and docs structure
6. Moved CHARTING_APP_DESIGN.md from momentum-trader
7. Fixed YAML path escaping issue (backslashes → forward slashes)
8. **Backend confirmed working** - API endpoints responding

## Work Completed

### 1. Startup Error Diagnosis
**Problem**: Backend failed to start with `FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified`

**Root Cause**: The file watcher was trying to watch `momentum-trader/data` directory using a relative path that didn't resolve correctly.

**Solution**: Created smart launcher scripts that auto-detect both the charting app and momentum-trader locations, then update `config/charting.yaml` with absolute paths.

### 2. Smart Launcher Scripts

#### Windows: `Momentum Trader Charts.bat`
- Auto-detects charting app location
- Auto-detects momentum-trader location
- Updates `config/charting.yaml` with absolute paths
- Creates `momentum-trader/data` directory if missing
- Activates venv and starts backend
- Can be copied anywhere (Desktop, etc.) and still work

#### Linux/Mac: `Momentum Trader Charts.sh`
- Same functionality as Windows version
- Uses bash syntax and Unix paths

#### Updated Scripts
- `scripts/start-backend.bat` - Now delegates to main launcher
- `scripts/start-backend.sh` - Now delegates to main launcher

### 3. Project Rules (.clinerules)
Created comprehensive project guidelines including:
- Project context and relationship to momentum-trader
- Environment architecture (Mac/Windows/GitHub workflow)
- Session documentation requirements
- Project structure overview
- Configuration management (auto-detection system)
- Code standards (error handling, platform compatibility)
- Git workflow and commit format
- Testing reminders

### 4. Session Notes Structure
- Created `session-notes/` directory
- Created `session-notes-index.md` for tracking sessions
- Created this session file as template

### 5. Documentation Structure
- Created `FEATURE_SUGGESTIONS.md` - Single source of truth for feature tracking
- Created `docs/` directory with `archive/` subdirectory
- Created `docs/README.md` - Documentation guide
- Moved `CHARTING_APP_DESIGN.md` from momentum-trader to `docs/`
- Updated `.clinerules` with documentation organization guidelines

### 6. YAML Path Fix
**Problem**: Backend failed with YAML parsing error:
```
expected escape sequence of 8 hexadecimal numbers, but found 's'
```

**Root Cause**: Windows paths like `C:\Users\bagol` have backslashes that YAML interprets as escape sequences (`\U` tries to be Unicode escape).

**Solution**: Updated `Momentum Trader Charts.bat` to convert backslashes to forward slashes:
```batch
SET "MOMENTUM_DIR_YAML=%MOMENTUM_DIR:\=/%"
```

Result: `C:/Users/bagol/trading-projects/momentum-trader/data` works correctly in YAML.

### 7. Backend Confirmed Working
```
[OK] Watchlist reloaded: 5 stocks
[OK] Runners reloaded
[OK] File watcher started for: C:/Users/bagol/trading-projects/momentum-trader/data
[OK] Charting backend started on port 8081
```

API endpoints tested:
- `http://localhost:8081/api/health` ✅
- `http://localhost:8081/api/watchlist` ✅
- `http://localhost:8081/api/runners` ✅

## Files Modified

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `Momentum Trader Charts.bat` | Created + Fixed | Windows smart launcher with path fix |
| `Momentum Trader Charts.sh` | Created | Linux/Mac smart launcher |
| `scripts/start-backend.bat` | Modified | Delegates to main launcher |
| `scripts/start-backend.sh` | Modified | Delegates to main launcher |
| `.clinerules` | Created | Project rules and guidelines |
| `session-notes-index.md` | Created | Session tracking index |
| `session-notes/2026-01-15.md` | Created | This session file |
| `FEATURE_SUGGESTIONS.md` | Created | Feature tracking document |
| `docs/README.md` | Created | Documentation guide |
| `docs/CHARTING_APP_DESIGN.md` | Moved | Full design doc from momentum-trader |
| `README.md` | Updated | Added documentation links |

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Run `Momentum Trader Charts.bat` from project root
- [x] Verify it finds momentum-trader automatically
- [x] Verify `config/charting.yaml` is updated with absolute paths (forward slashes)
- [x] Verify backend starts successfully
- [x] Test API endpoints (health, watchlist, runners)
- [ ] Copy `Momentum Trader Charts.bat` to Desktop and test

## Key Takeaways
1. Relative paths in config files can cause issues when the working directory isn't what's expected
2. Auto-detection startup scripts (like momentum-trader uses) solve the "where is the project" problem elegantly
3. The charting app depends on momentum-trader being installed - this should be documented clearly
4. **Windows YAML gotcha**: Backslashes in paths are escape sequences - must convert to forward slashes

## Next Steps
1. Continue frontend development (Electron + React)
2. Test candle data fetching from Schwab API
3. Consider adding the charting app startup to momentum-trader's launcher (optional companion app)

# Session 2 - Phase 3 Analysis Panels Implementation

## Status
✅ **Complete** - All Phase 3 analysis panels working

## Session Overview
1. Fixed Similar Past Setups panel - API endpoint and data format
2. All analysis panels now functional with live data

## Work Completed

### 1. Similar Past Setups (HistoricalPatternMatch) Panel Fix

**Problem**: Panel showed "No trade history available" despite having completed trades.

**Root Cause**:
- The charting backend (port 8081) didn't have a `/api/trade-history` endpoint
- The component was trying to fetch from an endpoint that didn't exist

**Solution**:
1. Added `/api/trade-history` endpoint to `backend/api/routes.py`
2. Endpoint reads from `momentum-trader/data/paper_trading/trade_outcomes.jsonl`
3. Returns parsed JSONL trade records to the frontend

**Code Added** (`routes.py:88-112`):
```python
@router.get("/trade-history")
async def get_trade_history():
    """Get trade history from momentum-trader's trade_outcomes.jsonl"""
    config = load_config()
    data_dir = Path(config['data_sources']['momentum_trader']['data_dir'])
    outcomes_path = data_dir / 'paper_trading' / 'trade_outcomes.jsonl'

    if not outcomes_path.exists():
        return []

    trades = []
    try:
        with open(outcomes_path, 'r') as f:
            for line in f:
                line = line.strip()
                if line:
                    try:
                        trade = json.loads(line)
                        trades.append(trade)
                    except json.JSONDecodeError:
                        continue
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Failed to load trade history: {e}")

    return trades
```

**Data Format**: The `TradeOutcomeRecord` interface in the frontend matches the JSONL format with nested structure:
- `entry.price`, `exit.price`, `outcome.winner`, etc.
- `market_context` contains gap_percent, catalyst_type, relative_volume, float

### 2. Analysis Panels Summary

All four Phase 3 analysis panels are now working:

| Panel | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Signal Strength Gauge** | ✅ Working | Composite 0-100% score combining catalyst, volume, VWAP, float, timing |
| **Timeframe Alignment** | ✅ Working | Shows trend alignment across 1m, 5m, 15m, Daily timeframes |
| **Exit Signal Dashboard** | ✅ Working | Real-time exit signals (VWAP loss, profit target, volume exhaustion) |
| **Similar Past Setups** | ✅ Working | Historical pattern matching against completed trades |

### 3. Similarity Algorithm

The `HistoricalPatternMatch` component calculates similarity between current setup and historical trades:

**Scoring Weights**:
- Same symbol: 40 points (most important for showing your trades on same ticker)
- Catalyst match: 30 points (exact match), 20 points (similar), 5 points (known type)
- Price range: 30 points (within 15%), 20 points (within 30%), 10 points (within 50%)
- Gap % bonus: 10 points if gap ratios are within 70%

**Minimum threshold**: 20% similarity to be included in results

## Files Modified

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `backend/api/routes.py` | Modified | Added `/api/trade-history` endpoint |
| `src/renderer/components/panels/HistoricalPatternMatch.tsx` | Existing | Uses new endpoint, parses TradeOutcomeRecord |

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Backend restarted with new endpoint
- [x] `/api/trade-history` returns JSONL trade records
- [x] Similar Past Setups panel loads trade history
- [x] Panel shows matching trades when symbol is selected
- [x] Win rate and Avg R statistics display correctly

## Key Takeaways
1. The charting backend serves data from momentum-trader's data directory
2. JSONL format in `trade_outcomes.jsonl` has nested structure - interface must match
3. Same-symbol matching is weighted highest since traders want to see their history on specific tickers
